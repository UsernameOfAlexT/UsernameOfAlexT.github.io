A couple of random things I made:

There's [courier-279][courier]. An old project created as part of a webdev class final project in a team of two.
No longer up, but the source can still be viewed.

[wise-garbage-can][discord-bot] is a nonsensically named bot for the messaging application discord.
Built using JavaScript and discord.js and is mostly just for personal use in a couple small servers.

[My personal website][museum-of-junk]. As the description says, just a place to put curious creations and other one-off ideas that aren't quite fully developed

That's it as of now. More random stuff might be added as time goes on
